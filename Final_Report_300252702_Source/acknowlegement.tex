\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{C:ack} 
I wish to thank Dr. David J. Pearce for the support throughout the project. This involved providing feedback, advice and general help. Without such, this project would have suffered greatly. I would like to thank Dr. Roman Klapaukh, Micheal Winton and Hai Tran for the encouragement throughout the year and A/Prof Lindsay Groves for helping with some proof reading.
