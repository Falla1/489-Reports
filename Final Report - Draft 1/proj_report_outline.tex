\begin{abstract}

As a project's test suite continues to grow throughout development, how can we ensure that the first test is not the same as the thousandth? This report explores progress made toward allowing for identification of potential redundant test cases through using a list of method executions made by a test case. Two different metrics are used to explore whether two tests are redundant or not. However the evaluation shows that some of the implementation's such as weighting method calls needs additional work. The report also examines the future work that will be undertaken.
